# FEUP-BD-PROJ

Group project for the BD course unit at FEUP.

The objective of the project was to create a database for a fictional online video game store (like [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) or [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/store/)).

The project was divided into three deliveries, each focused on a different part of the course content.

The project reports and most of the sql commands are in portuguese.
